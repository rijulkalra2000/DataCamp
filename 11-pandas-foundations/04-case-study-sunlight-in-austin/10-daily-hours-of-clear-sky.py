'''
Daily hours of clear sky

In a previous exercise, you analyzed the 'sky_condition' column to explore the difference in temperature on sunny days compared to overcast days. Recall that a 'sky_condition' of 'CLR' represents a sunny day. In this exercise, you will explore sunny days in greater detail. Specifically, you will use a box plot to visualize the fraction of days that are sunny.

The 'sky_condition' column is recorded hourly. Your job is to resample this column appropriately such that you can extract the number of sunny hours in a day and the number of total hours. Then, you can divide the number of sunny hours by the number of total hours, and generate a box plot of the resulting fraction.

As before, df_clean is available for you in the workspace.

Create a Boolean Series for sunny days. Assign the result to sunny.
Resample sunny by day and compute the sum. Assign the result to sunny_hours.
Resample sunny by day and compute the count. Assign the result to total_hours.
Divide sunny_hours by total_hours. Assign to sunny_fraction.
Make a box plot of sunny_fraction.
